\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Advantages or Semiconductor Detectors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good energy resolution due to small energy to generate information carriers (electron-hole pairs)
    \item High-density (solid)
    \item Good charge carrier collection properties
    \item Good timing characteristics
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Semiconductor vs. Gas Detectors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Similarities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ionization of detector material creating positive and negative charge carriers 
        \item Drift and collection of charge carriers due to external electric field
        \item Induction of signal during charge collection due to motion of charge carriers
    \end{itemize}
    \item Differences:\\
    A semiconductor detectors has
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Solid state counter with higher density and ($dE/dx$)
        \item Smaller energy to generate charge carriers
        \item Higher mobility
        \item Both types of charge carriers are fast
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Principles of Operation}
\subsubsection{Band Gap and Ionization Energy}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/semiconductor_band_structure.png}
    \caption{Band structure for insulators and semiconductors.}
    \label{fig:semiconductor_band_structure}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In band theory, the energy of any electron within the pure material is confined to allowed energy bands, which may be separated by gaps or ranges of forbidden energies. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:semiconductor_band_structure}, the valence band corresponds to outer-shell electrons that are bound to specific lattice sites within the crystal; the conduction band represents electrons that migrate freely through the crystal. The band gap separates the two bands.
    \item Excitations in the crystal, where a valence electron gains sufficient energy to be elevated across the band gap into the conduction band, creates an electron-hole pair, analogous to a ion pair in gases. Ionizing radiation creates electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor as charge and information carriers. 
    \item As shown in the table below, the ratio of W to band gap is approximately constant for a wide range of materials, reflecting the constant ratio between electron-hole generation and phonon generation. See figure~\ref{fig:Si_Ge_properties} for more detailed Si and Ge intrinsic properties.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
         &  Mean Ionization Energy W (eV) & Density (g/cm$^3$) & Fano Factor \\
        \hline
        Gases     & 30 & $7\sim50\times10^{-4}$ & $0.1\sim0.2$ (ionization vs. excitation)\\
        \hline
        Si & 3.62 & 2.33 & $\sim0.10$ (ionization vs. phonons)\\
        \hline
        Ge & 2.96 & 5.32 & $\sim0.10$ (ionization vs. phonons)\\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \item Semiconductor diode detectors, however, are limited by the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trapping and recombination centers lead to partial charge carrier loss and degradation in energy resolution
        \item Pulse height defects for heavy charged particles (e.g. fission fragments), due to energy loss in the entrance window and the dead layer, the competition between nuclear and electronic processes at decreased velocities, and the high electron-hole recombination rate in the plasma created along (especially at the end of) the ion track. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Lattice, Intrinsic Carrier Density,  Mobility, and Resistivity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lattice:\\
    Both Ge and Si have the diamond cubic crystal structure.
    \item Intrinsic carrier density:\\
    The intrinsic (no dopant) carrier density in a semiconductor is low.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Assuming equilibrium between thermal excitation and recombination, 
        \item[] the concentration of electrons (or holes) $n_i=\sqrt{N_CN_V}\exp(-E_{Gap}/2k_BT)$
        \item[] , where $N_V$ and $N_C$ are the densities of states in the valence and conduction bands.
        \item[] Typical values of $n_i$ are $2.5\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ for Ge and $1.4\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ for Si.
        \item[] However, for example in Si, the atomic density $n_{atoms}=\frac{N_A\rho}{M}\approx5\times10^{22}\;\text{cm}^{-3}$
        \item[] Therefore, $f=(1.5\times10^{10})/(5\times10^{22})=3\times10^{-13}$ 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mobility ($\mu$) and resistivity ($\rho$):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] The drift velocity is given by $v_{e/h}=\mu_{e/h}E$
        \item[] Current density $J=\text{charge density}\times v=en_i(\mu_e+\mu_h)E$
        \item[] Since $J=\sigma E$ where $\sigma$ is conductivity,
        \item[] $\rho=1/\sigma=[en_i(\mu_e+\mu_h)]^{-1}$
        \item[] Assuming only thermal excitations, where $n_i=n_p=n_e$, 
        \item[] with $n_i=10^{10}\;cm^{-3}$ and $\mu_e=1500\;cm^2/Vs$, then $\rho\sim10^5\;\Omega\cdot cm$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Doped Semiconductors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item n-type:\\
    Doped with group V elements (donors), the current is mainly due to excess electrons
    \item p-type:\\
    Doped with group III elements (acceptors), the current is mainly due to excess holes
    \item p-n junction:\\
    A depleted (charge carrier free) zone can be created by combining n and p regions to form a p-n junction due to charge carrier diffusion. The electric field or contact potential caused by the new space charges stop the diffusion. See figure~\ref{fig:pn_junction_formation} for visualization of the process.
    \begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{p-n junction formed due to charge carrier diffusion.}
        \label{fig:pn_junction_formation}
    \end{figure}
    \item Reverse-biased diode:\\
    By applying reverse bias, the depleted region of the p-n junction increases. See figure~\ref{fig:reverse_bias_diode}. 
    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/reverse_bias_diode.png}
        \caption{Reverse-biasing of a diode.}
        \label{fig:reverse_bias_diode}
    \end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Depletion Layer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depletion depth of a idealized junction (see figure~\ref{fig:depletion_depth_calc}):
    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/depletion_depth_calc.png}
        \caption{Charge distribution (left), electric field (center), and potential (right) of a idealized junction.}
        \label{fig:depletion_depth_calc}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the idealized situation where the electron diffusion is assumed to result in a uniform positive space charge (ionized donor sites) over the region $-a<x\leq0$, and the hole diffusion results in a uniform negative space charge over the region $0\leq x<b$, 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $\rho(x)=eN_D\;(-a<x\leq0)$
            \item[] $\rho(x)=eN_A\;(0<x\leq b)$
            \item[] $N_Da=N_Ab$ , due to charge neutrality
        \end{itemize}
        \item Poisson's equation states $\nabla^2\phi=-\rho/\epsilon$, where $\phi$ is the potential and $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the material.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}=-\frac{eN_D}{\epsilon}\;(-a<x\leq0)$
            \item[] $\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}=+\frac{eN_A}{\epsilon}\;(0<x\leq b)$
        \end{itemize}
        \item With integration and the boundary condition that $E=-d\phi/dx=0$ at $x=-a$ and $x=b$,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $\frac{d\phi}{dx}=-\frac{eN_D}{\epsilon}(x+a)\;(-a<x\leq0)$
            \item[] $\frac{d\phi}{dx}=+\frac{eN_A}{\epsilon}(x-b)\;(0<x\leq b)$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Further integration and boundary conditions of $\phi(-a)=V$ and $\phi(b)=0$ yields
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $\phi(x)=-\frac{eN_D}{2\epsilon}(x+a)^2+V\;(-a<x\leq0)$
            \item[] $\phi(x)=+\frac{eN_A}{2\epsilon}(x-b)^2\;(0<x\leq b)$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Since the above expressions of $\phi(x)$ has to match at $x=0$, with the condition given by charge neutrality,  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $V-\frac{eN_D}{2\epsilon}(x+a)^2=\frac{eN_A}{2\epsilon}(x-b)^2$
            \item[] $(a+b)b=\frac{2\epsilon V}{eN_A}$
        \end{itemize}
        \item In this example, we assumed $N_D\gg N_A$, and hence $b\gg a$. Then $d\approx b$, and 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $d\approx\left(\frac{2\epsilon V}{eN_A}\right)^{1/2}$
        \end{itemize}
        An opposite assumption would have given a identical result except that $N_A$ would be replaced $N_D$
        \item The generalized solution is therefore 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $d\approx\left(\frac{2\epsilon V}{eN}\right)^{1/2}$
        \end{itemize}
        , where $N$ is the dopant concentration on the side of the junction that has the lower dopant level.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Characteristics of the depletion layer:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Depletion voltage:\\
        The reverse bias voltage is increased to extend the depletion region across the entire thickness $T$ of the detector.\\
        $V_d={(eNT^2)}/{(2\epsilon)}$
        \item Operational voltage:\\
        The reverse bias voltage is further increased to above the depletion voltage to ensure full charge collection with sufficiently high electric fields across the depletion region.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Si Detectors}
\subsubsection{Varieties of Si Detectors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Diffusion junction diodes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Junction formed by exposing a p-type material to a vapor of n-type impurity, which converts a region at the surface from a p-type material to a n-type material. For example, a n+ contact with Li or P diffusion at $\sim1000^\circ C$ on p-type material.
        \item Since the n-type surface layer is heavily doped compared with the p-type original crystal, the depletion region extends primarily into the p side of the junction. Much of the surface layer is therefore outside the depletion region, forming a dead layer. For the example given above, there would be a thick n+ dead layer.
        \item Carrier lifetime is reduced due to the high temperature process. 
        \item Earliest implementation, has been replaced in nearly all applications.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Silicon surface barrier (SSB) devices:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Junction is formed between a semiconductor and certain metals. The depletion region behaves similar to that of the diffusion junction diode. 
        \item One production method is etching of the surface of n-type Si, followed by evaporation of a thin Au layer for electrical contact. Better results are obtained if slight oxidation occurs and an oxide layer is created between the Au and Si.
        \item Another method is to start with a p-type crystal and evaporate Al to form a n-type contact. 
        \item Very thin dead layer; the thickness can be measured by measuring the energy loss of particles within this layer. 
        \item Sensitive to light; the energy of visible photons is 2$\sim$4 eV, larger than the band gap.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ion-implanted diodes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An alternative method of introducing doping impurities at the surface of the semiconductor is to expose that surface to a beam of ions produced by an accelerator. 
        \item A n+ contact can be formed by P implantation, and a p+ contact can be formed by B implantation.
        \item The annealing temperature is $\sim500^\circ C$; the crystal is less disturbed and carrier lifetimes are not necessarily reduced. 
        \item Very thin entrance window
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Si(Li) Detectors}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/SiLi_Detector.png}
    \caption{Configuration of a Si(Li) detector.}
    \label{fig:SiLi_Detector}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Si detectors can be favored over Ge detectors in certain areas, despite its lower Z implying a smaller photoelectric cross section for typical gamma energies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Very low energy gamma or X-ray detection:\\
        In this region, the probability for photoelectric absorption can be reasonably high even for Si detectors of a few millimeters in thickness. The fact that X-ray escape peaks from silicon are less prominent than in germanium and that transparency to high energy gammas when low-energy photons are of interest makes Si(Li) detectors a common choice in low-energy photon spectrometry (LEPS) systems. 
        \item Detection and spectroscopy of beta particles or other externally incident electrons:\\
        The lower Z of Si means that fewer electrons will backscatter from the detector without full energy deposition. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Intrinsic high-purity Si detectors have limited thickness of $<2$ mm due to a minimum impurity concentration of $\sim10^{12}\;\text{cm}^{-3}$ (due to the crystal growth process) and a maximum applicable voltage of $<2000$ V (leakage current degrades energy resolution). 
    \item Li-drifting in p-type Si compensates the impurities. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:SiLi_Detector}, a p-i-n junction is formed once the drifting is completed. The excess Li at the surface which the drift was started forms a n+ electrical contact. The non-compensated p region at the opposite end is often given a metallic coating that acts as an ohmic contact. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Si Detector Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Position-sensitive Si detectors:\\
    Strip-detectors, micro-strip detectors, Si-drift detectors (good energy resolution at room temperature), circular Si-drift detectors (high energy resolution)
    \item $\alpha$-particle spectroscopy
    \item Conversion electron spectroscopy and counting
    \item X-ray spectroscopy, fluorescence, or imaging
    \item Charged particle timing, energy measurement, and identification ($\Delta$E-E telescope)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ge Detectors}
\subsubsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ge has a smaller band gap (0.7 eV) than Si (1.1 eV).
    \item Ge has a higher density and higher Z than Si.
    \item Low impurities in Ge allows much larger volumes to be depleted.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Planar and Coaxial Configurations}
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/HPGe_planar_config.png}
    \caption{Planar configuration of HPGe detectors.}
    \label{fig:HPGe_planar_config}

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/HPGe_cylindrical_config.png}
    \caption{Coaxial configuration of HPGe detectors. Note that $\nu$ and $\pi$ are used to represent the high purity of n- and p-type material respectively.}
    \label{fig:HPGe_cylindrical_config}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Planar HPGe detectors:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Configuration:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item See figure~\ref{fig:HPGe_planar_config}. The bulk of the detector is either p-type or n-type.
            \item The electrical n+ contact is usually made by Li diffusion (thick), and the p+ contact is usually made by B implantation (thin). 
            \item If the bulk of the detector is a n-type crystal, the p+ contact is the rectifying contact; if the bulk of the detector is a p-type crystal, the n+ contact is the rectifying contact. 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Electric field and capacitance:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Depletion depth $d=\left(\frac{2\epsilon V}{\rho}\right)^{1/2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant and $\rho$ is the charge density.
            \item Depletion voltage $V_d=\frac{\rho T^2}{2\epsilon}$ for slab thickness $T$
            \item With Poisson's equation $\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}=-\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}$ and the boundary condition $\phi(d)-\phi(0)=V$,
            \item[] the electric field $E=-\frac{d\phi}{dx}=\frac{V}{d}+\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\left(\frac{d}{2}-x\right)$
            \item Capacitance $C=\left(\frac{\epsilon\rho}{2V}\right)^{1/2}$ for $V<V_d$;
            \item[] for $V>V_d$, $C=\left(\frac{\epsilon\rho}{2V_d}\right)^{1/2}=\text{constant}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Coaxial HPGe detectors:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Configuration:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item See figure~\ref{fig:HPGe_cylindrical_config}. Generally, the bulletized closed-ended coaxial configuration is preferred. It provides a planar front surface where leakage currents do not have to be dealt with; bulletizing (rounding the front corners of the crystal and hole) and extending the hole to reach close to the front surface help keep the field lines as nearly radial as possible. 
            \item Similar to what is discussed for the planar configuration, the crystal could be either $\pi$-type or $\nu$-type. 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Electric field and capacitance:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Depletion voltage $V_d=\frac{\rho}{2\epsilon}[r_i^2\ln(r_o/r_i)-\frac{1}{2}(r_o^2-r_i^2)]$
            \item Electric field $E(r)=\frac{\rho}{2\epsilon}r-\frac{[V+(\rho/4\epsilon)(r_o^2-r_i^2)]}{r\ln(r_o/r_i)}$
            \item Capacitance per unit length $C=\frac{2\pi\epsilon}{\ln(r_o/r_i)}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Energy Spectra and Efficiency}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Characteristic features of a Ge energy spectrum:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Full-energy peak: $E_\gamma$
        \item Compton background (continuum)
        \item Compton edge: $E_{e-}(\theta=\pi)=E_\gamma-E_\text{backscatter}$\\
        Note that since Compton scattering is an interaction with electrons, the position of the Compton edge is at the same energy for all detector types.
        \item Compton backscatter: $E_\text{backscatter}=E_\gamma/(1+2E_\gamma/m_ec^2)$
        \item Single escape peak: $E_\gamma-511\;keV$
        \item Double escape peak: $E_\gamma-1022\;keV$
        \item Sum peaks from pile-up
        \item Annihilation peak: $E=511\;keV$
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/intrinsic_pn_efficiency.png}
        \caption{The efficiency difference at low energies arises because of the thick outer contact of p-type crystals contrasted with a thin contact on n-type crystals. Low-energy photons are absorbed in the dead layer when entering a p-type crystal. A notch in the curve for n-type crystals can be seen at 11 keV; this is the K-shell binding energy of Ge.}
        \label{fig:intrinsic_pn_efficiency}
    \end{figure}
    \item Efficiency:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Absolute full-energy (peak) efficiency:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $\epsilon_\text{abs}=\frac{\text{counts in photopeak}}{\text{number of gamma rays emitted by source}}=\epsilon_\text{int}\times\epsilon_\text{geo}$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Intrinsic full-energy (peak) efficiency:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $\epsilon_\text{int}=\frac{\text{counts in photopeak}}{\text{number of gamma rays incident on detector}}$
            \item See figure~\ref{fig:intrinsic_pn_efficiency} for discussion on differences between p- and n-type detectors.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Geometric efficiency:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $\epsilon_\text{geo}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2+a^2}}\right)$, where $d$ is distance $a$ is detector radius
        \end{itemize}
        \item Relative full-energy (peak) efficiency:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Relative to a $3''\times3''$ NaI(Tl) detector, generally for $E_\gamma=1332.5\;keV$ of Co-60, at a distance of 25 cm. 
            \item[] $\epsilon_\text{abs}(\text{NaI})=1.2\times10^{-3}$, $\epsilon_\text{int}(\text{NaI})=0.210$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Peak-to-total ratio:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $r=\frac{\text{counts in photopeak}}{\text{total counts on the entire spectrum}}=\frac{\epsilon_\text{peak}}{\epsilon_\text{total}}$
            \item A good detector has $r\sim0.6$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Peak-to-Compton ratio:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Defined as the ratio of the count in the highest photopeak channel (typically of $E_\gamma=1332.5\;keV$ of Co-60) to the count in a typical channel of the Comptom continuum associated with the peak (usually sampled in the relatively flat portion just left to the rise towards the Compton edge). 
            \item Measures the combined effects of detector energy resolution and photofraction. (A good detector has $\Delta E<0.2\%$ for $E_\gamma>1\;MeV$)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Varieties of Ge Detectors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compton Suppression Methods:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compton rejection by coincidence:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Compton continuum is formed due to the escape of scattered photons from the active volume before they undergo photoelectric absorption.
            \item Coincident detection of the escaping photons in a surrounding annular detector can reject events that only add to the continuum; pulses from the HPGe is rejected at an electronic gate if a coincident pulse is detected from the surrounding detector (anti-coincidence mode).
            \item The surrounding detector must be large enough and has good enough efficiency to intercept most escaping photons. Common choices are large scintillation detectors such as NaI(Tl) and BGO (BGO preferred for its high Z and high $\rho$). 
            \item Minimum amount of absorbing is required between the inner HPGe and the outer surrounding detector; n-type HPGe detectors are therefore preferred due to the relatively thin contacts. 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Sum-coincidence mode:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Events are only accepted if coincidences are found in two or more independent segments of the detector. The output from all segments is then summed and recorded. 
            \item The resulting spectrum is generally composed of only the full-energy peak and a suppressed, featureless continuum with no specific edge.
            \item Improvements are accomplished at the expense of a reduction of the full-energy peak, since events that correspond to full-energy absorption within one segment are also rejected. 
            \item One possible implementation is a spectrometer that consists of two concentric coaxial HPGe detectors. 
            \end{itemize}
        \item The pair spectrometer: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Two additional detectors placed on opposite sides of the primary detector can intercept the pair-production annihilation photons. When coincidence is found among all three detectors, the highly specific double escape events are found.
            \item While most of the continuum is suppressed, so is the full-energy peak; counting efficiency is considerably sacrificed. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item LN$_2$-cooled HPGe detectors:\\
    Due to the small $0.7\;eV$ band gap of Ge, LN-cooling is required to minimize thermally-induced leakage current and the associated electronic noise. In addition, the cooling is used to minimize the noise in the first amplification step of the preamplifier (J-FET optimal operation temperature is $\sim120\;K$). 
    \item Mechanically-cooled HPGe detectors:\\
    Overcomes the limitations of LN, especially for field work.
    \item Composite HPGe detectors:\\
    Further increases detection efficiency, which consists of several closely packed crystals in the same cryostat (e.g. clovers).
    \item Point contact HPGe detectors:\\
    The HPGe detector is operated as ``drift'' detectors, similar to Si drift in a TPC. It has a low energy threshold, very high resolution, and multi-site event rejection capabilities.
